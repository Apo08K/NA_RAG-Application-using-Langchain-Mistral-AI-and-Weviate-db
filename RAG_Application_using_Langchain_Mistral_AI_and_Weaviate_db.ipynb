Xu1∗Luyu Gao1∗Zhiqing Sun1∗Qian Liu2\\nJane Dwivedi-Yu3Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1Graham Neubig1\\n1Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University\\n2Sea AI Lab3FAIR, Meta\\n{zhengbaj,fangzhex,luyug,zhiqings,gneubig}@cs.cmu.edu\\nAbstract\\nDespite the remarkable ability of large lan-\\nguage models (LMs) to comprehend and gen-\\nerate language, they have a tendency to hal-\\nlucinate and create factually inaccurate out-\\nput. Augmenting LMs by retrieving informa-\\ntion from external knowledge resources is one\\npromising solution. Most existing retrieval aug-\\nmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate\\nsetup that only retrieves information once based\\non the input. This is limiting, however, in\\nmore general scenarios involving generation\\nof long texts, where continually gathering in-\\nformation throughout generation is essential. In\\nthis work, we provide a generalized view of ac-\\ntive retrieval augmented generation , methods\\nthat actively decide when and what to retrieve\\nacross the course of the generation. We propose\\nForward- Looking Active REtrieval augmented\\ngeneration ( FLARE ), a generic method which\\niteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming\\nsentence to anticipate future content, which is\\nthen utilized as a query to retrieve relevant doc-\\numents to regenerate the sentence if it contains\\nlow-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along\\nwith baselines comprehensively over 4 long-\\nform knowledge-intensive generation tasks/-\\ndatasets. FLARE achieves superior or compet-\\nitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating\\nthe effectiveness of our method.1\\n1 Introduction\\nGenerative language models (LMs) (Brown et al.,\\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Chowd-\\nhery et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Touvron et al.,\\n2023; Zhao et al., 2023) have become a founda-\\ntional component in natural language processing\\n(NLP) systems with their remarkable abilities. Al-\\nthough LMs have memorized some world knowl-\\nedge during training (Petroni et al., 2019; Roberts\\net al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020), they still tend to\\n∗Lead contributors.\\n1Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/\\njzbjyb/FLARE .hallucinate and create imaginary content (Maynez\\net al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021). Augmenting LMs\\nwith retrieval components that look up relevant in-\\nformation from external knowledge resources is a\\npromising direction to address hallucination (Khan-\\ndelwal et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022).\\nRetrieval augmented LMs commonly use a\\nretrieve-and-generate setup where they retrieve doc-\\numents based on the user’s input, and then generate\\na complete answer conditioning on the retrieved\\ndocuments (Chen et al., 2017; Guu et al., 2020;\\nLewis et al., 2020; Izacard and Grave, 2021; Sachan\\net al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022;\\nIzacard et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Qian\\net al., 2023; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023).\\nThese single-time retrieval augmented LMs outper-\\nform purely parametric LMs, particularly for short-\\nform knowledge-intensive generation tasks such\\nas factoid question answering (QA) (Kwiatkowski\\net al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2017), where the informa-\\ntion needs are clear in the user’s input, and it is\\nsufficient to retrieve relevant knowledge once solely\\nbased on the input .\\nIncreasingly powerful large LMs have also\\ndemonstrated abilities in more complex tasks that\\ninvolve generating long-form output, such as long-\\nform QA (Fan et al., 2019; Stelmakh et al., 2022),\\nopen-domain summarization (Cohen et al., 2021;\\nHayashi et al., 2021; Giorgi et al., 2022), and\\n(chain-of-thought; CoT) reasoning (Wei et al.,\\n2022; Ho et al., 2020; Geva et al., 2021; Hendrycks\\net al., 2020). In contrast to short-form generation,\\nlong-form generation presents complex informa-\\ntion needs that are not always evident from the in-\\nput alone . Similar to how humans gradually gather\\ninformation as we create content such as papers,\\nessays, or books, long-form generation with LMs\\nwould require gathering multiple pieces of knowl-\\nedge throughout the generation process .

It is crucial to retrieve extra information as\\nneeded during generation, such as when generat-\\ning a certain aspect (e.g., Joe Biden’s education\\nhistory) or a specific detail (e.g., the date of Joe\\nBiden’s presidential campaign announcement).\\nSeveral attempts have been made to retrieve mul-\\ntiple times throughout generation. These attempts\\ninclude methods that passively use the past context\\nto retrieve additional information at a fixed interval\\n(Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022;\\nRam et al., 2023; Trivedi et al., 2022) which might\\nnot accurately reflect what LMs intend to gener-\\nate in the future or retrieve at inappropriate points.\\nSome works in multihop QA decompose the full\\nquestion into sub-questions, each of which is used\\nto retrieve extra information (Press et al., 2022; Yao\\net al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Khattab et al., 2022).\\nWe ask the following question: can we create a\\nsimple and generic retrieval augmented LM that ac-\\ntively decides when and what to retrieve throughout\\nthe generation process, and are applicable to a va-\\nriety of long-form generation tasks? We provide a\\ngeneralized view of active retrieval augmented gen-\\neration. Our hypothesis regarding when to retrieve\\nis that LMs should retrieve information only whenthey lack the required knowledge to avoid unneces-\\nsary or inappropriate retrieval that occurs in passive\\nretrieval augmented LMs (Khandelwal et al., 2020;\\nBorgeaud et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Trivedi\\net al., 2022). Given the observation that large LMs\\ntend to be well-calibrated and low probability/con-\\nfidence often indicates a lack of knowledge (Ka-\\ndavath et al., 2022), we adopt an active retrieval\\nstrategy that only retrieves when LMs generate low-\\nprobability tokens. When deciding what to retrieve ,\\nit is important to consider what LMs intend to gen-\\nerate in the future, as the goal of active retrieval is to\\nbenefit future generations. Therefore, we propose\\nanticipating the future by generating a temporary\\nnext sentence, using it as a query to retrieve rel-\\nevant documents, and then regenerating the next\\nsentence conditioning on the retrieved documents.\\nCombining the two aspects, we propose Forward-\\nLooking Active REtrieval augmented generation\\n(FLARE ), as illustrated in Figure 1. FLARE iter-\\natively generates a temporary next sentence , use\\nit as the query to retrieve relevant documents if it\\ncontains low-probability tokens and regenerate the\\nnext sentence until reaches the end.\\nFLARE is applicable to any existing LMs at\\ninference time without additional training.

We evaluate FLARE\\non 4 diverse tasks/datasets involving generating\\nlong outputs, including multihop QA (2WikiMul-\\ntihopQA), commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA),\\nlong-form QA (ASQA), and open-domain summa-\\nrization (WikiAsp) (Ho et al., 2020; Geva et al.,\\n2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Hayashi et al., 2021).\\nOver all tasks, FLARE achieves superior or com-\\npetitive performance compared to single-time and\\nmulti-time retrieval baselines, demonstrating the\\neffectiveness and generalizability of our method.\\n2 Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nWe formally define single-time retrieval augmented\\ngeneration and propose the framework of active\\nretrieval augmented generation.\\n2.1 Notations and Definitions\\nGiven a user input xand a document corpus D=\\n{di}|D|\\ni=1(such as all Wikipedia articles), the goal of\\nretrieval augmented LMs is to generate the answer\\ny= [s1,s2, ...,sm] = [w1, w2, ..., w n]containing\\nmsentences or ntokens leveraging information\\nretrieved from the corpus.\\nIn retrieval augmented LM, the LM typically\\npairs with a retriever that can retrieve a list of\\ndocuments Dq=ret(q)for a query q; the LM\\nconditions on both the user input xand retrieved\\ndocuments Dqto generate the answer. Since we\\nfocus on examining various methods of determin-\\ning when and what to retrieve, we follow exist-\\ning methods (Ram et al., 2023; Trivedi et al.,\\n2022) to prepend the retrieved documents before\\nthe user input to aid future generation for both\\nbaselines and our method for fair comparisons:\\ny=LM([Dq,x]), where [·,·]is concatenation fol-\\nlowing the specified order.\\n2.2 Single-time Retrieval Augmented\\nGeneration\\nThe most common choice is to directly use the user\\ninput as the query for retrieval and generate the\\ncomplete answer at once y=LM([Dx,x]).\\n2.3 Active Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nTo aid long-form generation with retrieval, we pro-\\npose active retrieval augmented generation. It is a\\ngeneric framework that actively decides when and\\nwhat to retrieve through the generation process,resulting in the interleaving of retrieval and genera-\\ntion. Formally, at step t(t≥1), the retrieval query\\nqtis formulated based on both the user input xand\\npreviously generated output y<t= [y0, ...,yt−1]:\\nqt=qry(x,y<t),\\nwhere qry(·)is the query formulation function. At\\nthe beginning ( t= 1), the previous generation is\\nempty ( y<1=∅), and the user input is used as the\\ninitial query ( q1=x). Given retrieved documents\\nDqt, LMs continually generate the answer until the\\nnext retrieval is triggered or reaches the end:\\nyt=LM([Dqt,x,y<t]),\\nwhere ytrepresents the generated tokens at the cur-\\nrent step t, and the input to LMs is the concatena-\\ntion of the retrieved documents Dqt, the user input\\nx, and the previous generation y<t. We discard\\npreviously retrieved documents ∪t′<tDqt′and only\\nuse the retrieved documents from the current step\\nto condition the next generation to prevent reaching\\nthe input length limit of LMs.\\n3 FLARE: Forward-Looking Active\\nREtrieval Augmented Generation\\nOur intuition is that (1) LMs should only retrieve\\ninformation when they do not have the necessary\\nknowledge to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate\\nretrieval, and (2) the retrieval queries should reflect\\nthe intents of future generations. We propose two\\nforward-looking active retrieval augmented gener-\\nation (FLARE) methods to implement the active\\nretrieval augmented generation framework. The\\nfirst method prompts the LM to generate retrieval\\nqueries when necessary while generating the an-\\nswer using retrieval-encouraging instructions, de-\\nnoted as FLARE instruct . The second method directly\\nuses the LM’s generation as search queries, denoted\\nas FLARE direct, which iteratively generates the next\\nsentence to gain insight into the future topic, and\\nif uncertain tokens are present, retrieves relevant\\ndocuments to regenerate the next sentence.\\n3.1 FLARE with Retrieval Instructions\\nInspired by Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), a\\nstraightforward way of expressing information\\nneeds for retrieval is to generate “[Search(query)]”\\nwhen additional information is needed (Schick\\net al., 2023), e.g., “The colors on the flag of\\nGhana have the following meanings.

There-\\nfore, we propose a more direct way of forward-\\nlooking active retrieval that uses the next sentence\\nto decide when and what to retrieve.\\n3.2.1 Confidence-based Active Retrieval\\nAs shown in Figure 1, at step t, we first generate a\\ntemporary next sentence ˆst=LM([x,y<t])with-\\nout conditioning on retrieved documents. Then we\\ndecide whether to trigger retrieval and formulate\\nqueries based on ˆst. If the LM is confident about ˆst,\\nwe accept it without retrieving additional informa-\\ntion; if not, we use ˆstto formulate search queries\\nqtto retrieve relevant documents, and then regen-\\nerate the next sentence st. The reason we utilize\\nsentences as the basis of our iteration is due to their\\nsignificance as semantic units that are neither too\\nshort nor too lengthy like phrases and paragraphs.\\nHowever, our approach can also utilize phrases or\\nparagraphs as the basis.\\nSince LMs tend to be well-calibrated that low\\nprobability/confidence often indicates a lack of\\nknowledge (Jiang et al., 2021; Kadavath et al.,\\n2022; Varshney et al., 2022), we actively trigger\\nretrieval if any token of ˆsthas a probability lower\\nthan a threshold θ∈[0,1].θ= 0means retrieval\\nis never triggered, while θ= 1 triggers retrieval\\nevery sentence.\\nyt=(\\nˆst if all tokens of ˆsthave probs ≥θ\\nst=LM([Dqt,x,y<t]) otherwise\\nwhere the query qtis formulated based on ˆst.\\n3.2.2 Confidence-based Query Formulation\\nOne way to perform retrieval is to directly use the\\nnext sentence ˆstas the query qt. This shares a sim-\\nilar spirit with methods that use generated hypo-\\nthetical titles or paragraphs from LMs as retrieval\\nqueries or evidences (Gao et al., 2022; Sun et al.,\\n2022; Yu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2021). We gen-\\neralize such techniques to long-form generation\\nwhere active information access is essential.\\nWe found retrieving with the next sentence\\nachieves significantly better results than with the\\nprevious context, as shown later in subsection 6.2.\\nHowever, it has a risk of perpetuating errors con-\\ntained in it. For example, if the LM produces the\\nsentence “Joe Biden attended the University of\\nPennsylvania” instead of the correct fact that he\\nattended the University of Delaware, using this er-\\nroneous sentence as a query might retrieve mislead-', metadata={'source': '/content/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

We propose two simple methods\\nto overcome this issue as illustrated in Figure 3.\\nMasked sentences as implicit queries.

An-\\nother method is to generate explicit questions that\\ntarget the low-confident span in ˆst.

Self-ask (Press et al., 2022) achieved\\nthis by manually inserting follow-up questions\\ninto downstream task exemplars as shown later\\nin Prompt D.2, which requires task-specific annota-\\ntion efforts. Instead, we developed a universal ap-\\nproach that generates questions for low-confidence\\nspans without additional annotation.

We use StrategyQA (Geva\\net al., 2021) which is a collection of crowdsourced\\nyes/no questions, e.g., “Would a pear sink in wa-\\nter?” We follow Wei et al. (2022) to generate both\\nthe chain-of-thought and the final yes/no answer.\\nDetails are included in Appendix B.\\nWe extract the final answer and match it against\\nthe gold answer using exact match.\\nLong-form QA Long-form QA aims to generate\\ncomprehensive answers to questions seeking com-\\nplex information (Fan et al., 2019; Stelmakh et al.,\\n2022). We use ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022) as our\\ntestbed where inputs are ambiguous questions with\\nmultiple interpretations, and outputs should cover\\nall of them. For example, “Where do the Philadel-\\nphia Eagles play their home games?” could be\\nasking about the city, sports complex, or stadium.\\nWe found in many cases it is challenging even for\\nhumans to identify which aspect of the question\\nis ambiguous. Therefore, we created another set-\\nting (ASQA-hint) where we provide a brief hint\\nto guide LMs to stay on track when generating an-\\nswers. The hint for the above case is “This question\\nis ambiguous in terms of which specific location or\\nvenue is being referred to.” Experimental setting\\ndetails are included in Appendix B.\\nWe use metrics from Stelmakh et al.

Since we focus on evaluating factuality, met-\\nrics with an emphasis on factual content (such as\\nEM, Disambig-F 1, UniEval) are more reliable than\\nmetrics computed over all tokens (ROUGE-L).\\n6.2 Ablation Study\\nImportance of forward-looking retrieval. We\\nfirst validate that forward-looking retrieval is more\\neffective than past-context-based retrieval. We run\\nablation experiments on 2WikiMultihopQA and\\nASQA-hint comparing retrieval using the previ-\\nous versus the next sentence. Specifically, both\\nmethods retrieve every sentence and directly use\\nthe complete previous/next sentence as queries. As\\nshown in Table 3, using the next sentence to retrieve\\nis clearly better than using the previous sentence,\\nconfirming our hypothesis.\\nWe also run previous-window approaches using\\ndifferent numbers of past tokens as queries.

Next, we inves-\\ntigate how active retrieval threshold θaffects per-\\nformance. To alter our method from not retrieving\\nto retrieving every sentence, we adjust the confi-\\ndence threshold θthat determines when to trigger\\nretrieval from 0 to 1. We then calculate the pro-\\nportion of steps/sentences where retrieval is acti-\\nvated, and present the performance based on it. As\\nshown in Figure 5, on 2WikiMultihopQA, the per-\\nformance plateaus when the retrieval percentage\\nexceeds 60%, indicating that retrieval when LMs\\nare confident is not necessary. On StrategyQA, the\\nperformance drops when the retrieval percentage\\nexceeds 50%, indicating that unnecessary retrieval\\ncan introduce noise and impede the original gen-\\neration process. We found triggering retrieval for\\n40%-80% of sentences usually leads to a good per-\\nformance across tasks/datasets.\\nEffectiveness of different query formulation\\nmethods We study implicit query formation by\\nmasking and explicit query formulation through\\nquestion generation.

Retrieving directly with the complete\\nsentence ( β= 0) is worse than masking tokens\\nwith low probabilities, confirming our hypothesis\\nthat low-confidence erroneous tokens can distract\\nretrievers. We compare implicit and explicit query\\nformulation methods in Table 6. Performances of\\nboth methods are similar, indicating that both meth-\\nods can effectively reflect information needs.\\n7 Related Work\\nWe refer to subsection 2.2 and section 4 for ex-\\ntensively discussion on single-time and multi-time\\nretrieval augmented LMs, which is the most rele-\\nvant area to this paper.\\nIterative and adaptive retrieval Iterative re-\\ntrieval and refinement has been studied in both\\ntext and code generation tasks (Peng et al., 2023;\\nZhang et al., 2023; Zemlyanskiy et al., 2022; Yu\\net al., 2023). FLARE differs from these methods in\\nthe granularity of generation and retrieval strategies.\\nAdaptive retrieval has been studied in single-time\\nretrieval scenarios based on either question pop-\\nularity or generation probabilities (Mallen et al.,\\n2022; Li et al., 2023), while we focus on long-form\\ngeneration requiring active information access.\\nBrowser-enhanced LMs WebGPT (Nakano\\net al., 2021) and WebCPM (Qin et al., 2023) train\\nLMs to interact with browser to enhance factuality\\nusing reinforcement learning or supervised train-\\ning where multiple queries can be triggered before\\ngeneration. FLARE is built on text-based retrievers\\nbut can be combined with a browser to potentially\\nimprove retrieval quality.8 Conclusion\\nTo aid long-form generation with retrieval aug-\\nmentation, we propose an active retrieval aug-\\nmented generation framework that decides when\\nand what to retrieve during generation. We imple-\\nment this framework with forward-looking active\\nretrieval that iteratively uses the upcoming sentence\\nto retrieve relevant information if it contains low-\\nconfidence tokens and regenerates the next sen-\\ntence. Experimental results on 4 tasks/datasets\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Fu-\\nture directions include better strategies for active\\nretrieval and developing efficient LM architectures\\nfor active information integration.\\n9 Limitations\\nWe also conduct experiments on Wizard of\\nWikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and ELI5 (Fan et al.,\\n2019), and found that FLARE did not provide sig-\\nnificant gains. Wizard of Wikipedia is a knowledge-\\nintensive dialogue generation dataset where the out-\\nput is relatively short ( ∼20 tokens on average) so\\nretrieving multiple disparate pieces of information\\nmight not be necessary. ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019)\\nis a long-form QA dataset requiring in-depth an-\\nswers to open-ended questions. Due to issues men-\\ntioned in Krishna et al. (2021) such as difficulties\\nof grounding generation in retrieval and evalua-\\ntion, both single-time retrieval and FLARE did not\\nprovide significant gains over not using retrieval.\\nFrom an engineering perspective, interleaving gen-\\neration and retrieval with a naive implementation\\nincreases both overheads and the cost of generation.\\nLMs need to be activated multiple times (once for\\neach retrieval) and a caching-free implementation\\nalso requires recomputing the previous activation\\neach time after retrieval. This issue can be poten-\\ntially alleviated with special architectural designs\\nthat encode the retrieved documents Dqtand the\\ninput/generation ( x/y<t) independently.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from\\nthe Singapore Defence Science and Technology\\nAgency and the IBM PhD Fellowship.

              " Document(page_content='A FLARE Implementation Details\\nFLARE instruct implementation details We\\nfound that LMs can effectively combine retrieval\\nand downstream task-related skills and generate\\nmeaningful search queries while performing the\\ntask. However, there are two issues: (1) LMs tend\\nto generate fewer search queries than necessary.\\n(2) Generating excessive search queries can\\ndisrupt answer generation and adversely affect\\nperformance. We address these issues using two\\nmethods respectively. First, we increase the logit\\nof the token “[” by 2.0 to improve the chances\\nof LMs generating “[Search(query)]”. Second,\\nwhenever LMs generate a search query, we use it\\nto retrieve relevant information, promptly remove\\nit from the generation, and generate the next few\\ntokens while forbidding “[” by adding a large\\nnegative value to the logit of “[”.\\nThe initial query of FLARE. FLARE starts\\nwith the user input xas the initial query to re-\\ntrieve documents to generate the first sentence\\nˆs1=LM([Dx,x])to bootstrap the iterative gener-\\nation process. For the following steps, the tempo-\\nrary forward-looking sentence is generated without\\nretrieved documents.\\nSentence tokenization. For each step t, we gen-\\nerate 64 tokens which are longer than most sen-\\ntences, and use NLTK sentence tokenizer5to ex-\\ntract the first sentence and discard the rest.\\nEfficiency As shown in subsection 6.2, on aver-\\nage retrieval is triggered for 30%∼60% of sen-\\ntences depending on downstream tasks. In compar-\\nision, KNN-LM (Khandelwal et al., 2020) retrieves\\nevery token, RETRO or IC-RALM (Borgeaud et al.,\\n2022; Ram et al., 2023) retrievers every 4 ∼32 to-\\nkens, and IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2022) retrieves\\nevery sentence. Compared to single-time retrieval,\\nhowever, interleaving retrieval and generation with\\na naive implementation indeed increases overheads,\\nwhich we discuss in the limitation section (sec-\\ntion 9).\\nB Datasets and Settings\\nDatasets, metrics, and experimental settings are\\nsummarized in Table 7.\\n5https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.\\nPunktSentenceTokenizer.htmlMultihop QA For “Why did the founder of Ver-\\nsus die?”, the output we aim to generate is “The\\nfounder of Versus was Gianni Versace. Gianni Ver-\\nsace was shot and killed on the steps of his Miami\\nBeach mansion on July 15, 1997. So the answer\\nis shot.” We use 8 exemplars from Trivedi et al.\\n(2022) listed in Prompt D.4 for in-context learn-\\ning, BM25 as the retriever, and Wikipedia articles\\nas the retrieval corpus. Similar to the observation\\nin Trivedi et al. (2022), we found incorporating\\nretrieval results for exemplars improves the per-\\nformance, we use the input xof each exemplar to\\nretrieve several documents and then add them using\\nthe format in Prompt D.1. We found increasing the\\nnumber of retrieval documents often increases per-\\nformance. Therefore, we use the maximum number\\nof documents that can fit within the input length\\nlimit of text-davinci-003 , which is 2 for 2Wiki-\\nMultihopQA.\\nCommonsense Reasoning For “Would a pear\\nsink in water?”, the output we aim to generate is\\n“The density of a pear is about 0.6g/cm3, which is\\nless than water. Objects less dense than water float.\\nThus, a pear would float. So the final answer is no.”\\nWe use 6 exemplars from Wei et al. (2022) listed in\\nPrompt D.5, BM25 on the Wikipedia corpus, and 3\\nretrieved documents to run experiments.\\nLong-form QA For “Where do the Philadelphia\\nEagles play their home games?”, the output we\\naim to generate is “We need to consider the dif-\\nferent possible locations or venues that could be\\nconsidered the home field of the Philadelphia Ea-\\ngles. These include the city, the sports complex,\\nor the stadium. Therefore, this question has 3 in-\\nterpretations and the answers are: (1) The city is\\nPhiladelphia. (2) The sports complex is the South\\nPhiladelphia Sports Complex. (3) The stadium is\\nthe Lincoln Financial Field stadium.” For both the\\noriginal setting (ASQA) and the setting with hints\\n(ASQA-hint), we manually annotate 8 exemplars\\n(Prompt D.6 and D.8), use BM25 on the Wikipedia\\ncorpus, and 3 retrieved documents to run experi-\\nments.\\nOpen-domain Summarization The original\\nWikiAsp dataset is designed for multi-document\\nsummarization and provides a list of references to\\nsystems. We converted it into the open-domain\\nsetting by removing the associated references and\\ninstead gathering information from the open web.\\nFor “Generate a summary about Echo School (Ore-', metadata={'source': '/content/pdf1.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

However, there are two issues: (1) LMs tend\\nto generate fewer search queries than necessary.\\n(2) Generating excessive search queries can\\ndisrupt answer generation and adversely affect\\nperformance. We address these issues using two\\nmethods respectively. First, we increase the logit\\nof the token “[” by 2.0 to improve the chances\\nof LMs generating “[Search(query)]”. Second,\\nwhenever LMs generate a search query, we use it\\nto retrieve relevant information, promptly remove\\nit from the generation, and generate the next few\\ntokens while forbidding “[” by adding a large\\nnegative value to the logit of “[”.\\nThe initial query of FLARE.
